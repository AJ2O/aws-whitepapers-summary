This summary is based off of the November 2020 revision of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation - Cloud Native Security Whitepaper](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-toc/attachment/5509/0/CNCF_cloud-native-security-whitepaper-Nov2020.pdf).

Patterns of development and deployment in the technology industry have shifted towards becoming "[cloud native](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/DEFINITION.md)", with adoptions to modern workflows such as [DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/) and [Agile](https://www.atlassian.com/agile). These processes have a focus on rapid development and deployment, requiring a need for security to meet the scale needs of these dynamic workloads in the cloud.

Cloud native development can be modelled in the distinct phases that comprise the application lifecycle, and security must be ensured at each phase:
- **Develop**
  - The process of writing and managing the application source code in a revision system
- **Distribute**
  - The process of building code and producing artifacts ready for deployment
- **Deploy**
  - The process of transferring artifacts to a runtime environment, and starting the application
- **Runtime**
  - The environment that contains the running application
    - Ex. Hardware, host, OS, container image runtime
  - In a [microservices architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/microservices/), an application may be distributed across multiple runtime environments

Cloud native security seeks to ensure the same levels of diligence, integrity, trust, and threat prevention as traditional security models, while integrating modern concepts of ephemerality, distribution, and immutability.

# Cloud Native Layers

## Lifecycle
A cloud native application's **lifecycle** refers to the technology, practices, and processes that enable workloads to run within the context of a cloud environment. It is comprised of four continuous phases: Develop, Distribute, Deploy, and Runtime.

## Develop


## Distribute


## Deploy


## Runtime


# Security Assurance

# Compliance
