# Overview

This summary is based off of the August 2019 revision of the **Implementing Microservices on AWS** whitepaper.

In a [**microservices architecture**](https://aws.amazon.com/microservices/), software is composed of small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. It allows for organizations to speed up development cycles, improve scalability of applications, and foster innovation. 

The focus of this whitepaper is to identify the features of a reliable, scalable, and easy-to-manage microservices architecture, and how to build it using AWS container and serverless technologies. Then the whitepaper discusses the cross-service aspects of microservices, such as service discovery, asynchronous communication, and distributed monitoring.
