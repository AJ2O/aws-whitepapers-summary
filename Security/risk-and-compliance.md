This summary is based off of the November 2020 revision of the AWS: Risk and Compliance whitepaper.

This whitepaper focuses on the AWS side of the [Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/), and how these security mechanisms are assured to be implemented effectively.

## Shared Responsibility Model

AWS and its customers share control over the IT environment, which includes security and compliance responsilities. Depending on the services used, this shared control can help relieve the customer's operational burden.

AWS secures the components of the host operating systems and below, down to the physical security of the data centers. The customer is responsible for tasks above the hosting layer, such as securing:
- Guest operating system
  -  Ex. updates, security patches
- Application software
  - Ex. code vulnerabilities, data encryption
- Networking
  - Ex. firewalls, host-based intrusion detection
- Essentially any configurations that the customer can directly control

AWS helps customers by managing controls associated with the physical infrastructure of the AWS environment. Customers can then use the **AWS control and compliance documentation** available to perform their control and verification procedures as required.

## Evaluating and Integrating AWS Controls

AWS provides a wide range of information about its IT control environment via: 
- technical papers
- reports
- certifications
- other third-party attestations

These documents provide AWS customers with visibility and independent validation of the control environment, and may relieve some requirements for customers to perform validation work themselves of their AWS environment.
