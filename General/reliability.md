This summary is based off of the July 2020 revision of the **Reliability Pillar - AWS Well-Architected Framework** whitepaper.

The AWS Well-Architected Framework (W-AF) helps customers learn the best architectural practices for designing and operating systems on the cloud. For a customer, it provides a way to measure their current cloud architecture decisions against best practices to identify areas for improvement, which will likely lead to increased business success. The W-AF consists of five pillars, and they are summarized in [its own whitepaper](./well-architected-framework.md).

This whitepaper in particular focuses on the **reliability** pillar of the W-AF, and how to apply it to cloud solutions. It encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when it's expected to. This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle. This paper provides in-depth, best practice guidance for implementing reliable workloads on AWS.
