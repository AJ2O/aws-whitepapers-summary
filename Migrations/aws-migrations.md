This summary is based off of the March 2018 revision of the **AWS Migration Whitepaper**. It covers migration strategies and considerations that organizations should be aware of in their partial integration or full migration to the cloud.

# The Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)
Assessing cloud migration readiness across key business and technical areas helps determine the most effective approach to an enterprise cloud migration effort. The [AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)](./caf.md) provides a mental model to establish six key areas, known by the CAF as Perspectives:

- **Business**
- **People**
- **Governance**
- **Platform**
- **Security**
- **Operations**

Addressing each Perspective is critical to synchronizing business and technical goals across the organization, and resulting in a successful cloud migration. To read about each Perspective in detail, including each Perspective's associated job roles, responsibilities, and capabilities, read the [AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) summary](./caf.md).
