# Overview
- [Source](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/AWS-Cloud-Transformation-Maturity-Model.pdf)

This summary is based off of the September 2017 revision of the **AWS Cloud Transformation Maturity Model** whitepaper. The objective of the AWS Cloud Transformation Maturity Model (CTMM) is to help enterprise IT organizations:
- Understand the significant challenges they might face as they adopt AWS,
- Learn best practices and activities to handle those challenges, and
- Recognize the signs of maturity or expected outcomes to measure their cloud maturity and readiness

# Introduction
The CTMM is a tool that enterprise customers can use to assess the maturity of their cloud adoption through four key stages: **project, foundation, migration,** and **optimization.** In order to fully benefit from the cloud, the whole organization has to transform and adopt it, not just the IT division. Each of the stages will be discussed in detail, and below is a summary each stage's challenges, activities, and outcomes of maturity.

# Project Stage
Starting in the **project** stage, organizations usually have limited knowledge of cloud services and their potential costs and benefits, and typically don't have a centralized cloud adoption strategy. The outcomes and lessons learned here lay the strong foundation for broader cloud adoption at all organizational levels.

## Challenges and Barriers
- **Limited knowledge and training**
  - Significant investment in training is required for IT staff and other business units to adopt the cloud model
- **Executive support and funding**
  - Executives are often skeptical and resistant to any new funding for IT infrastructure upgrades
- **Purchasing public cloud services**
  - Lack of awareness among the procurement and legal staff about the purchasing paradigms for cloud services
- **Limited confidence in cloud service models**
  - Cloud service infrastructure provisioning and management is significantly different compared to on-premises operation
- **IT ownership and direction**
  - IT leaders have to gain control of central IT ownership and communicate a clear transformation roadmap to all organization stakeholders

## Transformation Activities
- **Contact and AWS account manager**
  - An AWS account manager is a single point of contact who can connect a customer with AWS Partners and professional services to address all their needs
- **Raise the level of AWS awareness**
  - There are many AWS events, and education and training resources:
    - [AWS Business Essentials](https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/business-essentials/) for helping business leaders understand the benefits of cloud computing from the strategic business value perspective
    - [Online videos, hands-on labs, and training](https://www.aws.training/)
    - [AWS Whitepapers](https://aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/)
- **Secure executive support and funding**
  - AWS offers cost and value modeling workshops to provide the customer with the tools to perform a cost-benefit analyis as a basis for securing executive support and funding
- **Consider purchasing options**
  - Direct purchase from AWS
  - Indirect purchase from an AWS Partner
    - Acquire via contract vehicles to serve the needs of the public sector:
      - Federal, state, and local governments
      - Education institutions
- **Execute a pilot or proof-of-concept (POC) project**
  - Leverage a pilot project to test AWS implementation on representative workloads
- **Conduct an IT transformation workshop**
  - This workshop enables rapid cloud adoption by showing the customer how to replace uncertainty with a vision and strategy on how to derive value from AWS

## Outcomes and Maturity
- **Effective use of AWS resources**
- **Knowledgable and trained organization**
- **Executive support and funding**
- **Ability to purchase AWS and AWS professional services**
- **IT staff confidence and true buy-in**
- **Central IT ownership and a clear transformation roadmap**

# Foundation Stage
The **foundation** stage is characterized by the customer's intent to move forward with migration to AWS with executive sponsorship, some experience with AWS services, and partially trained staff. During this stage, the customer's environment is assessed, all contractual agreements are in place, and a plan is created for migration. The plan details the business case, in-scope workloads, approach to migration, resources required, and the timeframe.

## Challenges and Barriers
- **Assigning transformation support resources**
  - Effective execution requires a significant amount of time from key IT staff, who are likely already occupied with competing priorities of managing the current environment
- **Providing leadership through a transformation plan**
  - Plan needs to address all aspects of organizational change, including business, governance, service delivery, operations, roles and responsibilities, and more
- **Integrating security and compliance policies**
  - AWS needs to be integrated into the organization's existing security framework, and be compliant with regulatory requirements
- **Managing cost and budget**

## Transformation Activities
- **Establish a Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE)**
  - The CCoE should be a dedicated team with the following core responsibilities:
    - Defining central policies and strategy
    - Providing support and knowledge transfer to business units
    - Creating and provisioning AWS accounts for workload/program owners
    - Providing a central point of access control and security standards
    - Creating and managing common use-case architectures
  - The CCoE lowers the implementation and migration risk across the organization
  - Serves as the hub for sharing the best practices for a broader impact of cloud transformation throughout the organization
- **Develop security and compliance architecture**
  - Applies to systems as well as personnel
  - AWS Professional Services can assist with prescriptive guidance
- **Develop a value management plan**
  - Include tactical benefits such as:
    - Cost management
    - Prioritization of IT spending
    - System of allocating costs
  - Include strategic benefits such as:
    - Agility
    - Time to market
    - Innovation

## Outcomes and Maturity
- **CCoE for Cloud Governance**
  - The CCoE provides the following benefits:
    - Centralized expertise
    - Standardization of strategy and vision
    - Standardization of technical processes and procedures
    - Bias for action
      - The central cloud team has a vested interest in making sure that the cloud computing model is successful
- **Clear transformation roadmap**
- **Best practice security and compliance architecture**
- **Strong value management plan**
