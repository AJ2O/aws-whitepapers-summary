# Overview

This summary is based off of the February 2017 revision of the **An Overview of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework** whitepaper. It explains how the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) can assist organizations with the nuances, considerations, and changes that must be recognized in order to maximize benefit from cloud adoption.

# Introduction
Cloud adoption doesn't only entail technological changes, but also changes throughout all organizational units in the company. The CAF provides guidance that supports each unit so that each business area understands how to update skills, adapt existing processes, and use new processes that take full advantage of cloud computing services. CAF organizes guidance into **six Perspectives**, which are shown below:

- **Business**
- **People**
- **Governance**<br><br>
- **Platform**
- **Security**
- **Operations**

In general, the Business, People, and Governance Perspectives focus on **business capabilities**, and the Platform, Security, and Operations Perspectives focus on **technical capabilities**. A brief description of each Perspective is below, with detailed descriptions in later sections.
