This summary is based off of the July 2017 revision of the **Infrastructure as Code** whitepaper. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is the practice of defining and automating the provisioning of IT infrastructure (compute, network, storage, etc.) through configuration files, in a similar manner to how a software application is constructed by its application code. Rather than relying on manually performed steps, which are prone to human error, lack of agility, and excessive time spent, IaC uses automation to set up infrastructure more quickly and consistently each time.

This whitepaper describes the benefits of IaC, and the AWS services that can leverage IaC in order to foster increased velocity in the software development lifecycle.
